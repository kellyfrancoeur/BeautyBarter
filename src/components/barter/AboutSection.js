                    Any one who has worked in the beauty industry has likely at one point or another, traded services with a fellow provider. We keep each other looking and feeling our best while both supporting and promoting each other. But unless your salon was a full stop shop (which we are seeing less and less these days), you may have found yourself wishing you could trade other services as well but didn't know where to start or who to even ask. It's an awkward conversation to have with someone that you haven't already been working with.

                    Beauty Barter was created to help connect licensed professionals to a community of licensed professionals with similar goals - to trade their services in exchange for others. It takes the awkward conversation out of the situation because you already know the professionals that you are connecting with are also looking to trade.

                    Beauty Barter allows you to pick which of your services you wish to trade and those you wish to receive in return. You can set your prices to be sure you are setting up and receiving fair trades. You can include pictures of your work and links to your social media.
